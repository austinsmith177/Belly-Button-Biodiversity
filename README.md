# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## **Overview**

- This project focuses on bacterial species that are capable of synthesizing proteins. We test a hypothesis to see if there is an organism that can provide the best taste in beef.

## **Purpose**

- The purpose is to build a dashboard that shows the results of our hypothesis. The dashboard will hold multiple charts such as a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and a guage chart.

## **Results**

- The results shows the top 10 bacterial clusters that were found, on a horizontal bar chart.A bubble chart indicating the OTU ID per sample. A Gauge Chart to indicate the weekly washing frequency.

## **Summary**

- The bashboard was a success and helped eleborate on the hypothesis that was created.
